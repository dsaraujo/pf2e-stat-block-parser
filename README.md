# Starfinder Statblock Parser

A simple FoundryVTT module that allows GMs to parse the statblocks of Starfinder NPCs so they can quickly create NPCs.

## Use

To use simply go to the actors tab in FoundryVTT, and click the Parse Statblock button at the bottom. Paste in the statblock text, and click ok.
The main focus of this module is to support Paizo-style statblocks, this means you must include the category headers like defense, offense, statistics, etc.

An example stat block:
    Simple Mook CR 1/2
    LE Medium humanoid (human)
    Init +4; Perception +10
    DEFENSE HP 13
    EAC 10; KAC 12
    Fort +2; Ref +4; Will +0
    OFFENSE
    Speed 30 ft.
    Melee club +3 (1d6+2 B)
    Ranged azimuth laser pistol +6 (1d4+1 F; critical burn 1d4)
    STATISTICS
    Str +2; Dex +3; Con +1; Int –1; Wis +0; Cha –1
    Skills Athletics +4, Bluff +5, Intimidate +9, Stealth +5
    Languages Common
    Gear flight suit stationwear, azimuth laser pistol with
    battery (20 charges), club, credstick (150 credits)
